About Project :

In order to improve learning outcomes and guarantee academic achievement in the modern educational environment, monitoring and analyzing student performance is essential. 

The purpose of the Student Performance Analytics and Reporting System (SPARS) - Genius Track is to give educators and learners insightful data on academic performance.

 With the use of this web-based application, teachers may enter and evaluate performance data, provide thorough reports, and provide suggestions that can be put into practice to help students improve. In addition to tracking their academic achievement and pinpointing areas for growth, students have access to their performance reports. Through the provision of personalized feedback and real-time data analysis, SPARS enhances students' learning experiences and promotes better academic achievement by enabling educators to make well-informed judgements.

Problem Description: It might be difficult for many educational institutions to effectively monitor student performance and produce insights for development. Whereas students require a platform to track their development and pinpoint areas for improvement, teachers frequently lack the resources necessary to analyze academic data and generate reports that are practical. By providing instructors and students with immediate feedback and data-driven insights, a web-based system that addresses these problems might greatly improve academic achievements.
